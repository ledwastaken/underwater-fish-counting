# Underwater Fish Counting

Underwater Fish Counting is a deep learning project for counting fish in underwater images, including camouflaged or partially occluded fish. The project adapts the Indiscernible Object Counting (IOC) framework to the fish-counting task, leveraging pre-trained models and modern data augmentation techniques.
